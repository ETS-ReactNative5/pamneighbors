       Recent studies show that stress in the U.S. has taken a dramatic jump upward. An estimated 8.3 million Americans are now classified as suffering from high levels of “serious” stress.¹ These levels of stress are known to initiate diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and countless others. They often also result in hair loss, which can, in turn, raise a person’s level of stress even higher.

       The impact of losing one’s hair is now recognized as producing more stress at a higher severity than previously thought.² One type of loss of hair, known as telogen effluvium, results from a sudden traumatic event in life or a physical injury. Many of my female friends have shared how a tragic event in their lives left them holding handfuls of their own hair in the shower months later. Indeed, this type of stress triggered hair loss often occurs three months after the painful event.

       Exercise, therapy, meditation, and better nutrition are all important in diminishing our stress, and it is time to conquer that stress in any healthy way we can. Even eliminating our anxiety over how we look after losing fistfuls of hair is a healthy place to start. Fortunately, there is a process which, if applied by a skilled, experienced practitioner, can make hair look much fuller and bare spots far less noticeable.

       That process is scalp micropigmentation, and the pictures (all unedited here and taken of my personal clients only) tell the story of how well it works:
