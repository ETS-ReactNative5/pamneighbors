         In my Trillium Ink Academy classes, I teach extensive theory on the psychology of hair loss and the depression it can cause in both men and women. Yet, every now and then, a client comes along who is the very embodiment of resilience in the face this confidence-crushing life change. Ryan* is one of those men.
       </Typography>
       <Typography variant="p" style={styles.content} paragraph>
         At 6-foot-6 with a frame like a linebacker, it is hard to imagine him ever suffering from under confidence. Yet, in the 20 years since he began to suffer hair loss, Ryan tried every solution from Minoxidil to hair transplants. “I spent thousands of dollars on transplant ‘plugs’ only to have them die off. I later learned that this happens frequently, and what you are left with are scars instead. I finally gave up and paid for my first hair piece, and when I showed up to pick it up, there was no business by that name at the address!”
       </Typography>
       <Typography variant="p" style={styles.content} paragraph>
         Ryan’s struggle didn’t stop there. He told me about the next hair system he purchased, which resulted in a severe reaction to the adhesive. “I picked it up on Friday and by Monday I was in so much pain from the allergy that I had to take it back,” he said. “And the story gets worse. When I got the new one back, and I decided to wash it, dirt kept floating up out of it!” No one knows where that hairpiece had been.
        </Typography>
       <Typography variant="p" style={styles.content} paragraph>
         Eventually, Ryan found a no-allergy, no-dirt hair system piece that seemed to work for him, but the daily maintenance and secrecy involved wore thin. “I would still caution men that a hair system is glued to your head 24 hours a day, seven days a week! They should try to imagine how bad something would be after being glued to your head that long.”
       </Typography>
       <Typography variant="p" style={styles.content} paragraph>
         Still determined that a better solution must exist somewhere, he began surfing YouTube and ran across a new process called scalp micropigmentation (SMP), a tattooing application that mirrors natural hair follicles and results a shaved head look or buzz cut. “I thought this was really interesting, but at that point, I didn’t understand that the SMP process required a highly skilled specialist. I just thought a regular tattoo artist could do it. Luckily, my daughter, who is very into tattooing, stopped me in my tracks and said that SMP required extensive expert training and certification.”
       </Typography>
       <Typography variant="p" style={styles.content} paragraph>
         After interviewing several SMP practitioners, Ryan found me and took the leap. “That first free consult with you was so different,” he told me. “You were so educated and experienced, and you showed before and after pictures of men with such varied cases---and they all turned out with great, natural looks! I went home and told my wife that I did not want to spent money on somebody who was not an expert because I was going to have this for the rest of my life. I had to have it done correctly. Now I am so  happy that my wife keeps catching me with a mirror in my hand in the bathroom, still admiring all the angles and sides. It looks so good!”
       </Typography>
       <Typography variant="p" style={styles.content} paragraph>
         Ryan’s determination to find a hair loss solution that looked genuine and was low maintenance has made him “incredibly happy” with his new SMP look. Last week, he called me after a concert he attended to thank me again. “I am a big guy, so I had a birds-eye-view of everyone on the concert floor,” he said. “I started looking around for guys who had lost their hair, and a lot of them had shaved their heads, but I could still see where they had large bald patches with no hair follicles. My head now looks like a head that had hair--and I MEANT to shave it.  I was the only person in sight who had that kind of look.”
       </Typography>
       <Typography variant="p" style={styles.content} paragraph>
          Ryan’s advice for men who are experiencing hair loss is “Don’t Wait!”  If you can start SMP early, he says, you can fill in areas around the temple and crown and then just keep adding as you lose your hair. “This way, no one is aware of a drastic change later. But don’t go to some inexperienced person who is not a specialist in SMP—and working out of a trailer!”

         A Special Bonus
       </Typography>
       <Typography variant="p" style={styles.content} paragraph>
         When we follow a belief that there is something better out there, we often find more than we can imagine. Ryan has been happily married for a couple of years now, and after I completed his new SMP look, he surprised me by calling me back to get his eyebrows balanced (the outside half of each brow had been lost). He wanted to balance the look of his hair line. This time, his wife came with him. A week later, she was in my chair getting her brows tattooed, which normally would not be notable except that I discovered that she has suffered from an anxiety condition that causes excessive eyebrow pulling. Ryan’s resilience toward his own condition had opened the door for her to do the same. Her condition is gone now, and two confident people can move forward in life together.

       Recent studies show that stress in the U.S. has taken a dramatic jump upward. An estimated 8.3 million Americans are now classified as suffering from high levels of “serious” stress.¹ These levels of stress are known to initiate diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and countless others. They often also result in hair loss, which can, in turn, raise a person’s level of stress even higher.

     <Typography variant="p" style={styles.content} paragraph>
       The impact of losing one’s hair is now recognized as producing more stress at a higher severity than previously thought.² One type of loss of hair, known as telogen effluvium, results from a sudden traumatic event in life or a physical injury. Many of my female friends have shared how a tragic event in their lives left them holding handfuls of their own hair in the shower months later. Indeed, this type of stress triggered hair loss often occurs three months after the painful event.

       Exercise, therapy, meditation, and better nutrition are all important in diminishing our stress, and it is time to conquer that stress in any healthy way we can. Even eliminating our anxiety over how we look after losing fistfuls of hair is a healthy place to start. Fortunately, there is a process which, if applied by a skilled, experienced practitioner, can make hair look much fuller and bare spots far less noticeable.

       That process is scalp micropigmentation, and the pictures (all unedited here and taken of my personal clients only) tell the story of how well it works:
